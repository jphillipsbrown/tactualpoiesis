description: 'Created for “An Inventory of Al-Mutanabbi Street” in homage to and in
  mourning for the street of booksellers, this book takes its title from Aeneas’s
  words of sorrow uttered before a Carthaginian mural depicting the Trojan War. Tragedy
  must be brought home to us, but how can we relay the depths of loss—a very idea
  predicated on absence? This reliquary is part lachrymatory: it contains a book whose
  text of tears is designed to tear away at itself each time the book is displayed.
  Pleated into an accordion, it plays the elegy for its own effacement as, gradually,
  the cut-out letters catch on one another, pulling themselves up and off the page
  until they may fall away entirely.'
