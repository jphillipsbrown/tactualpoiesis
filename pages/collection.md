_Tactual Po√Øesis_ bears witness to a contemporary field of poetic practice that continues to become startlingly diverse and increasingly defined by its permeable borders with other intellectual disciplines. A variety of poetic schools now populate the field of contemporary poetry, from Neo-Formalism to Language and post-Language, and at the intersections between poetry and other disciplines, old practices continue to evolve and new practices emerge, including ecopoetics, ethnopoetics, haptic poetries, and digital poetries. Amidst this astonishing proliferation of poetic hybrids, contemporary women poets have produced some of the most varied and sumptuous investigations of text-image relations to date. This site's collection comprises images and information concerning a particularly rich field of text-image hybridity, bookworks by contemporary women poets in the Americas.
