As much as _Between Page and Screen_ highlights the digital, it also insists on materiality, physicality, and the body: without the reader, without the book, and also, of course, without the computer, no poems are possible. What mediates between the page and the screen, after all, as the title implies, is the reader. It is the reader’s body—her tactile engagement with the book’s pages and her kinetic performance before the camera’s lens—that drives the poïetic process. _Between Page and Screen_ functions as an anti-absorptive text (as Charles Berstein might say), reminding us that reading is a physical activity that depends upon the presence of and the interaction between the material text and the body. Without the senses and agency of the reader, there can be no poem, whether on the screen or on the page.

_Between Page and Screen_ is rare among contemporary collections of poetry in that it was first conceived both as a born-digital text and as a collaborative, limited-edition artist’s book. The project gained further notoriety in subsequent years following the publication of the trade edition with Siglio Press in 2012. The sumptuous materiality of the artist’s book, from its letterpress-printed pages on Rives BFK paper to its exposed butterfly binding and hand-sewn signatures, contrasts conspicuously with the digital instantiations of the text. For Borsuk, it was important that _Between Page and Screen_, both as a physical object and as a digital construct, embody the tensions between printed and digital media.

In every respect, the artist’s book edition of _Between Page and Screen_ is an invitation to the hand, as well as the eye, of the reader. The artist’s book was produced in a limited edition of twelve, in part because of its prohibitive material costs. The paper stock used for the book, Rives BFK, is a rich printmaking paper, prized by printers for its toothy, warm white surface. The butterfly binding, carefully sewn and exposed along the book’s spine, makes visible and tangible the techniques and materials of the book’s construction. In this first version, _Between Page and Screen_ also eschews color printing in favor of a starkly contrasted, black-on-white palette rendered in saturated lithographer’s ink. The cover itself is bare, however, except for a central, blind-printed logotype: a square inset with the title and a series of parallel diagonal lines. Here again, the cover suggests a text that functions texturally as well as visually.
