On September 11, 1973, Chileans at home and abroad bore witness to the untimely death of their first democratically elected president, Salvador Allende, and with him, the representative government of the Unidad Popular.[^1]

Cecilia Vicuña, then a twenty-four-year-old postgraduate student in London, suddenly found herself exiled from the only motherland she had ever known. Spared from any immediate threat of violence, Vicuña mourned from a distance, memorializing the irrevocable losses of country and culture in the first of her published books, _Sabor a Mí_ (1973).[^2] It was a cruel irony that in her exile, Vicuña was able to voice an immediate and unbridled response to the coup that would have been all but impossible within Chile’s borders.

As an artist’s book, _Sabor a Mí_ documents the poet’s experience of the coup through its compelling arrangement of visual, verbal, and tactile materials, including drawings, collages, paintings, photographs, diary entries, letters, poems, and essays. With respect to both its content and its form, _Sabor a Mí_ is one of the most important poetic representations of this most traumatic era in Chilean history, and yet, it continues to receive little critical attention. The book was published by Beau Geste Press, a small artist’s collective in England, with a print run of only 250 copies, which explains, in part, the book’s absence from the canon of literary responses to the coup.11 But if the book has struggled to find its audience, it is also because its unruly poetics confound conventional reading practices with every turn of the page.

In the decades since the coup, Vicuña has continued to rework and re-publish the content of _Sabor a Mí_ in numerous subsequent books. The most notable of these books, published by ChainLinks in 2011, might be called a “semi-facsimile” edition, since it both reproduces and significantly expands and recontextualizes the original book. Unlike its predecessor, _Saborami_ (2011) was published not under military dictatorship, but during the years of the Occupy Wall Street movement, when the streets near Vicuña’s home in New York teemed with organized protests and communal actions. In the intervening years, Vicuña has also become a poet, visual artist, and filmmaker of international renown, with works that combine elements of poetry, visual and performance art, and film. Thus _Saborami_ embodies a lifetime of Vicuña’s complex, multi-dimensional poetics, and it gains new relevance in the company of other groundbreaking works by contemporary women poets.
